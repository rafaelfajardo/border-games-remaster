Crosser 2.3 PlayerRead Me File Crosser is critical commentary in the form of a video game, conceived of as a piece of interactive digital art.To play crosser, double-click on the Crosser 2.3 Player icon. Then click once on the blinking start button. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to guide Carlos Moreno across the river, past the Border Patrol Agents, and to the visa card. A chance encounter with any of the hazards will send Carlos back tothe beginning of his journey. Click on the start button for Carlos to try again.Note: There is an intentional delay between the time a player presses an arrow key and the time Carlos reacts. This makes the game harder and forces the player to think. Go with it. Sometimes Carlos will overcome the hazards he encounters, or the Migra Man will "look the other way," allowing Carlos to pass. This adds a realistic sense of random chance to the game. Go with it. Sometimes Carlos will walk across the blinking start button when he has been sent back. This is due to keystroke caching. Move Carlos off the start button with the arrow keys and you will then be able to restart his journey. Cool Things About CrosserCrosser is artCrosser is softwareCrosser is political commentaryCrosser is cultural criticismCrosser is not politically correctCrosser is multi-level homageCrosser is cuteCrosser is simple to learnCrosser is challenging to playCrosser is different every time you playCrosser is guaranteed to bring you hours of funCreditsRafael A.

Crosser has been tested - and successfully played - on a Macintosh IIci running Mac OS 7.6, and on a Macintosh G4 running Mac OS 9. It plays the same across this spectrum. The game window will fit nicely on a monitor set to 800 x 600 pixels, or finer, and which uses a minimum of 256 colors (8bit color).Cocoa, Macintosh, and Mac OS are trademarks of Apple Computers Inc.All other trademarks are property of their respective owners.Crosser and the Carlos Moreno character are copyright © 1999, 2000, 2001 Rafael Fajardo.email: rafaelfajardo@flash.net
